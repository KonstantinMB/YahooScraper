# YahooScraper
This is a stock information web scraper from Yahoo Finance.
In order for it to run, you have to have two csv files in one folder with the code.
One file is for the stock symbols with header being 'Symbols' (just like in the Input.csv I've attached here)
The second csv file is for the data. It needs to be blank and after running the code, it will be full of information.
